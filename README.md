# ConsultMoviesProject
This project used the The movie DB API to display information about movies. It was fully designed using UIKit (no SwiftUI). All the view were created
programatically, without .storyboard or interface builder. As of now the code lacks an architecture and only allows to access the data of the 50 most popular
movies on 12/August/2022. The logic needs to be improved because the images seen in the scrollview sometimes don't match with the information displayed when 
tapping on the images. The buttons on the top of the second view are inactive as of now. It would be interesting to try this projet on swiftUI.
